						<h4>Eliminating Distractions</h4>
						<p>
							To help stop procrastination, you need to eliminate any distractions that will take your mind off the task you need to do.
							This can be done by:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Setting any devices to silent or Do not disturb</li>
								<li>Putting your phone away from your desk</li>
								<li>Turning off any notifications that may distract you</li>
								<li>Using a website blocker to block any sites that may distract you</li>
								<li>Letting people know that you are working and not to disturb you</li>
					</ol>

					</div>
				</li>

				<li class="card">
					<div class="card-content">
						<h4>Environment</h4>
						<p>
							Your environment can have a big impact on your productivity. If you are in a messy environment, you are more likely to be distracted and procrastinate.
							To help stop procrastination, you need to make sure your environment is clean and tidy. </p>
						<p>
							Another way to minimise procrastination is by making a dedicated workspace. As <a href="https://www.amba-uk.com/blogs/how-can-a-dedicated-workspace-reap-the-benefits/">studies</a>  have shown that having a dedicated workspace can help you focus and be more productive.

					<div class="card-content">
						<h4>Music</h4>
						<p>
							Another way to help stop procrastination is by listening to music. Listening to music can help you focus and be more productive. However, it is important to listen to the right type of music.
							According to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-athletes-way/201412/why-does-music-help-us-during-exercise">study by Psychology Today</a> , listening to music with a fast tempo can help you be more productive and focused. This is because fast tempo music can help you get into a flow state.
							This is one of the techniques that helped me the most and I have found that listening to synth-wave music helps me focus and be more productive as its fast-paced but has no lyrics to distract me.

				</li>

				<li class="card">
					<div class="card-content">
						<h4>Rewards</h4>
						<p>
							Another way to help stop procrastination is by rewarding yourself. This can be done by setting a reward for yourself after you have completed a task. This can help motivate you to complete the task.
							However, it is important to make sure that the reward is not too big. If the reward is too big, you may be tempted to procrastinate and not complete the task.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>

				<li class="card">
					<div class="card-content">
						<h4>Timing / Sessions</h4>

						<p>
							Another way to help stop procrastination is by timing your work. This can be done by using the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique that breaks down work into intervals. This technique can help you focus and be more productive.
							To use the Pomodoro technique, you need to: </p>
							<ol>
								<li>Choose a task you need to do</li>
								<li>Set a timer for 25 minutes</li>
								<li>Work on the task until the timer goes off</li>
								<li>Take a 5-minute break</li>
								<li>Repeat steps 2-4 three more times</li>
								<li>After the fourth session, take a 20-minute break</li>
								<li>Repeat steps 2-6 until the task is done</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Luckily nowadays a lot of modern technology has this built in. For example, the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-focus-in-windows-11-cbcc9ddb-8164-43fa-8919-b9a2af072382">  Windows Focus Sessions </a>, which is a built-in to the clock app that allows you to use the Pomodoro technique.

						<h4>Evaluation</h4>

						<p>
							Before Focusing on this study skill, I would often procrastinate and not get any work done. This would lead to me being stressed and having to rush to get the work done.
							These tools and methods have helped me stop procrastinating and be more productive. I have found that the Pomodoro technique has helped me the most. This is because it has helped me focus and be more productive.
							I also started to listen to live music broadcasts of synth-wave music on YouTube. This helps as I don't have to worry about changing the music or restarting the playlist.
							Now obviously, I am not perfect and I still procrastinate sometimes but when this happens its best not get overwhelmed and to just take a few moments to catch your breath and think about what it could've been that caused you to procrastinate.
